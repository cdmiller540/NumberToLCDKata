# Number To LCD
Credit to http://codingdojo.org/kata/NumberToLCD/

### Part 1
Write a program that given a number (with arbitrary number of digits), converts it into LCD style numbers using the following format:
```markdown
   _  _     _  _  _  _  _  
 | _| _||_||_ |_   ||_||_|  
 ||_  _|  | _||_|  ||_| _|  

(each digit is 3 lines high)
```
Note: Please do NOT read the second part before completing the first.

### Part 2
Change your program to support variable width or height of the digits. For example for width = 3 and height = 2 the digit 2 will be:
```markdown
 ___
    |
    |
 ___
|
|
 ___
```
